            <h1>About Zach, Founder & Content Creator</h1>
            <p>Zachariah Goldenberg has been a math nerd since the early 90s, he loves to solve problems and help people learn stuff.</p>
            
            <p>Zach attended Plymouth State University where he double majored in Mathematics and Political Science. After graduating he has worked as a licensed securities trader at Fidelity Investments, an actuary at Liberty Mutual, and as a solar sales consultant at Tesla. He's currently teaching high school math and picked up his masters in data analytics to boot!</p>
            
            <p>Actions speak louder than words. Zach started tutoring in middle school and volunteering in high school. Thousands of hours of volunteer work both domestically and internationally along with taking a major pay cut to begin teaching show what he is all about. Math My Money is one way he's trying to make the world a better place through education. However cliché it may sound, empowering people financially allows them to pursue their dreams and it becomes a snowball effect.</p>
            
            <p>All that aside, Zach's known to make a mean pizza along with the occasional giant snowman. He lives in New Hampshire with his wife and son.</p>

            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>Anyone offering financial advice should be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism, especially when it comes to investing. I don't promise untold riches or the next hot stock pick. I won't tell you what to do. I will help educate and explore options with you so that you can make the best decisions for yourself (because you're the only one who can make them). Think about how long you've spent researching and struggling to figure out what it is that you're currently focused on. How much easier and more efficient could that process be with my help? If I don't think I can add value then I'll say so and save us both the time.</p>
            
            <h3>Topics can include but are not limited to:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Debt (organize, eliminate, then celebrate)</li>
                <li>Goal Setting (where do you want to be in 5, 10, 20 years)</li>
                <li>Budgeting (how to make one and stick to it)</li>
                <li>College and Career (should you go, where to go, and what to go for)</li>
                <li>Investing (from stocks and bonds to cryptocurrencies and NFTs)</li>
                <li>Real Estate (renting for yourself, buying a house, or rental properties)</li>
                <li>Retirement (how much will you need and when)</li>

            <p>I AM NOT a: financial advisor (SEC definition), broker-dealer (buy/sell securities), CFP (Certified Financial Planner), CPA (Certified Public Accountant), ChFC (Chartered Financial Consultant), or asset/fund/investment/portfolio manager. If you'd like to work with any of these fine folks go right ahead. Please make sure that they are acting as a fiduciary and not just following a suitability standard. I'm not at all offended if you don't want to work with me but it's very important whoever you do work with has your best interests above their own.</p>
            
            <p>I AM a financial coach. This is a title that means basically nothing, seriously. I suggest that you treat me like a stranger from the internet, unless you know me in real life… in which case that would be weird. Look at my credentials/background, the content I create, and my motivations when deciding if you'd like to work with me.</p>

                <li>I make personal finance content that explores the ideas and shows how things work rather than nonsense get rich schemes</li>
                <li>I want to work with individuals who want to invest in themselves</li>

            <p>I have a mortgage, am a pretty big fan of electricity, and enjoy eating every day. Sessions like these are a way for me to work 1-1 with people while monetizing what I do so that I can continue producing videos and articles for free for everyone. Time is money! If the time we spend working together leads to you saving or earning at least what you paid, then it will have been worth it. That's the mutual goal and I'm confident we can achieve it.</p>

            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>To be of service to a business as a consultant one must learn quickly and think critically. I've had multiple roles which required mastery of highly complex products and procedures, that's where I bring the most value. Working in investments, insurance, sales, education, and consulting I've seen a number of different scenarios which out of the box thinking allowed me to excel. Every business has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. As a consultant I will help identify what those are and offer up actionable solutions to meet your goals.</p>
