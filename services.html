            <h2>Personal Finance Coaching</h2>
            <p>Feeling overwhelmed when it comes to money? How do you know if you're "on track", and what does that even
                mean?
                How should you even start? If you are ready for your money to work for you but don't know what to do, a
                1-1 coaching session may be just the trick!</p>
            <p>These sessions ARE NOT financial advice, they ARE coaching and education.</p>

            <h2>Business Consulting</h2>
            <p>Are you working hard but your business is underperforming? Ever consider utilizing advanced analytics to
                drive business forward? Could a new perspective on a persistent problem help? If you want to optimize
                operations and maximize profitability, a consulting session may help to do so!</p>
            <p>The reality is that hard problems require creative solutions. Details may differ from one situation to
                the next but the fundamentals do not. Identify issues, explore options, apply a solution, monitor the
                results, and iterate the process. That's my approach to problem solving.</p>
