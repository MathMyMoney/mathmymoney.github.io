        <h1>Business Consulting</h1>

        <p>Are you working hard but your business is underperforming? Ever consider utilizing advanced analytics to
            drive business forward? Could a new perspective on a persistent problem help? If you want to optimize
            operations and maximize profitability, a consulting session may help to do so!</p>

        <p>The reality is that hard problems require creative solutions. Details may differ from one situation to the
            next but the fundamentals do not. Identify issues, explore options, apply a solution, monitor the results,
            and iterate the process. That's my approach to problem solving.</p>

        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>To be of service to a business as a consultant one must learn quickly and think critically. I've had multiple
            roles which required mastery of highly complex products and procedures, that's where I bring the most value.
            Working in investments, insurance, sales, education, and consulting I've seen a number of different
            scenarios which out of the box thinking allowed me to excel. Every business has its own set of strengths and
            weaknesses. As a consultant I will help identify what those are and offer up actionable solutions to meet
            your goals.</p>

        <h3>Areas can include but are not limited to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Operations, processes, and performance</li>
            <li>Pricing and profitability</li>
            <li>Data analytics and metrics</li>
            <li>Research and strategic goals</li>
            <li>Customer service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
        <p>Most consultants work on a contract and there are no set qualifications. Only you know what your organization
            needs. If you're unsure of whether my expertise is the right fit, feel free to reach out and ask. If I don't
            think I can add value then I'll say so and save us both the time.</p>

        <p>Look at my experience, credentials/background, and the content I create when deciding if you'd like to work
            with me.</p>
